## Abstract 

Novel view synthesis is a long-standing topic at the intersection of computer vision and computer graphics, where the fundamental goal is to synthesize animage from a novel viewpoint given a sparse set of reference images. The rapid development of deep learning has introduced a wide range of new ideas and methods in novel view synthesis where parts of the synthesis processare considered as a supervised learning problem. 
Specifically, neural scene representations paired with volume rendering have achieved state of the art results in novel view synthesis, but still remains a nascent field facing a lack ofliterature. This thesis presents an overview of learning-based view synthesis, experiments with state-of-the-art view synthesis methods, evaluates them quantitatively andqualitatively and finally discusses their properties. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multi-view stereo dataset captured with a hand-held camera and demonstrate the process of collecting and preparing multi-view stereo datasetsfor view synthesis. The findings in this thesis indicate that learning-based view synthesismethods excel at synthesizing plausible views from challenging scenes, including situations with complex geometry as well as transparent and reflective materials. Furthermore, we found that it is possible to render such scenes in real-time and greatly reduce the time to prepare a scene for view synthesis by using a pre-trained network that aggregates information from nearby views.
